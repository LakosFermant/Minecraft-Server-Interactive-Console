# Minecraft-Server-Interactive-Console
A WIP WinForms project where the goal is to run a CMD Minecraft Server embedded in a windows application and a UI, while also still saving memory from using the Java jar. Its at the point where the cmd can be launched through the application, but it opens as a seperate window and not embedded in the application. Also still need a text bar to input to the program. One day i'll get this finished, hopefully.
